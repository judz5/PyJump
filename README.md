# StringGame
Bounce A ball up by drawing strings

This is basically a copy of Lynez by dafluffypotato just seems like a cool game idea that introduces some cool physics ive never worked with before.

### As of now my biggest concerns are
- Collision with lines 
- figure out the gravity after i hit a line
- calculating the angle to launch ball based on angle of line

### Lynez's Source is the project I am using for inspiration
The code is only in here so i can access it on my school computer <3
