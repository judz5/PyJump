# PyJump
### A Pygame Doodle Jump Clone (With Lasers!)
If you want to attempt to contribute good luck, my code is a bit jumbled and shoved into one python file.

#

This was my second 9 Weeks project for my Independent Study Class.\
I had alot of fun coding this and making a real game, hopefully it is somewhat enjoyable to play.

All you need is Python and Pygame to play, The highscore can be reset in settings and is stored locally.
