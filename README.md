# PyJump
My project has changed from its first idea of drawing strings to a game similar to doodle Jump

I changed the project idea because I knew the physics and collision of the lines was going to be too much trouble
and I feel that making this game which is a simplier concept but making it look good is a better path for me to take

I plan for this game to be fun to play, and have custom made sprites, particles, and other effects to make the game stand out

 - Side note, I know this code is really bad and doesnt use pygames sprites correctly, if at all. As of now all that im worried about is it working, I'm more so just using this as a base to prove I can make something with pygame. My next pygame project will have much better code.
