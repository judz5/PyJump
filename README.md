# PyJump
My project has changed from its first idea of drawing strings to a game similar to doodle Jump

I changed the project idea because I knew the physics and collision of the lines was going to be too much trouble
and I feel that making this game which is a simplier concept but making it look good is a better path for me to take

I plan for this game to be fun to play, and have custom made sprites, particles, and other effects to make the game stand out
